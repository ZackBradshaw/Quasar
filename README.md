# ðŸŒŒ Quasar Fullstack ðŸŒŒ

Dive into the cosmic realm of Quasar, a fullstack solution designed to navigate the nebulae of numbers and equations. With a suite of tools from training to inference, Quasar is your answer to mastering mathematical reasoning.

## âœ¨ Features:

- **Inference**: Rapidly infer results using `inference.py`.
- **Simple Setup**: A straightforward setup using `simple.py`.
- **Fine-tuning**: Adapt and optimize with `finetune.py`.
- **Training**: Lay the foundation of your reasoning with `train.py`.

## ðŸ›¸ Directory Structure:

```
Quasar/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ inference.py
â”œâ”€â”€ simple.py
â”œâ”€â”€ finetune.py
â””â”€â”€ train.py
```

## ðŸŒ  Installation:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Quasar/
   ```

2. **Setup your environment**:

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment to maintain a clean workspace.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   Make sure you're in the Quasar directory.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ðŸš€ Usage:

1. **Inference**:

   ```bash
   python inference.py <arguments-if-any>
   ```

2. **Simple Setup**:

   ```bash
   python simple.py <arguments-if-any>
   ```

3. **Fine-tuning**:

   ```bash
   python finetune.py <arguments-if-any>
   ```

4. **Training**:

   ```bash
   python train.py <arguments-if-any>
   ```

Feel free to raise issues or contribute to Quasar. We welcome all astronomers (read: developers) who want to explore this galaxy with us!

Note:
- I've assumed that there is a `requirements.txt` file that lists all the necessary dependencies for the project.
- The placeholders `<arguments-if-any>` suggest that the python files may take arguments. If they do not take any arguments or if you want to specify them, you should modify this line appropriately.
- Ensure that you replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.
- You may need to further specify or adjust paths and details depending on the actual architecture and layout of your project.
